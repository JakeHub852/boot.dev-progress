## 🗓️ 2025-05-26 – Session 1

- Learned what code is: a sequence of instructions executed in order.
- Started working on the “Fantasy Quest” RPG project
- Practiced simple output and expressions with `print(250 + 75)`.
- Fixed a basic math bug in the Boot.dev code editor.
- Edited and corrected in-game dialogue using `print()` statements.
- Explored syntax vs logic errors and how to debug them.
- Fixed syntax error in `print((250 + 241 + 244 + 255) / 4)`.
- Understood why Python isn’t used in the browser:
  - Browsers run JavaScript natively, not Python.
  - Python workarounds like Brython or Pyodide are slow and limited.
- Learned what Python *is* good for: backend development, automation, and data analysis.
- Set up Git and GitHub repo (`boot.dev-progress`) for tracking progress.
- Committed first Markdown notes and code snippets using Git Bash.

## 🗓️ 2025-05-26 – Session 2

- Added a shell script (`mkdatefile.sh`) to generate date-formatted filenames.
- Learned the basics of **variables** in Python:
  - Variables store values using descriptive names (`my_height = 100`).
  - Values can be text strings or numbers and can change over time.
  - Printed variable values using `print(my_height)`.
- Explored **mathematical operators**:
  - `+` addition, `-` subtraction, `*` multiplication, `/` division.
  - Used parentheses to control operation order: `(a + b + c) / 3`.
- Practiced applying math with variables to simulate health reduction.
- Added new Python snippet: `code-snippets/2025_05_26_armored-health.py`.
- Learned about **negative numbers** and their use in expressions.
- Introduced **comments**:
  - Single-line with `#`, multi-line using triple quotes `""" """` (docstrings).

## 📅 2025-05-26 - Session 3


- Practiced Git commands in Git Bash (add, commit, push).
- Switched from `nano` to **VSCode** for editing Markdown files.
  - Editing is smoother and formatting issues are gone.
  - Learned how to open folders and preview `.md` files in VSCode.
- Learned to use VSCode for writing clean, structured Markdown:
  - Used code blocks (` ```python `) for Python syntax highlighting.
  - Formatted lists, headings, and comments more clearly.
- Created and committed a combined `.md` file:
  - **`python-backend-vs-frontend.md`**
  - Explained why Python is good for backend, and why it’s not used for frontend.
- Began learning about f-strings.

## 📅 2025-05-27 - Session 1

- Continued learning about NoneTypes
- Added **NoneType** concept file to concepts for later reference
- **Dynamic typing** and **Static typing**
- Added file to concepts
- Used **concatenation** to combine variables 
- Did some simple math to calculate average scores in the game
- Added character report to code snippets
- Use Git Bash to push to GitHub
