## 📌 Variables

A variable is just a name that stores a value.

Example
my_height = 100

- Variable names should be descriptive.
- Use a single token: lowercase with underscores (snake_case)
- You can store numbers, text, or other data types.

Mathematical Operators

summation = a + b      # Addition
difference = a - b     # Subtraction
product = a * b        # Multiplication
quotient = a / b       # Division

Use parenthesis to control the order of operations:

avg = (a + b + c) / 3

Comments make code easier to understand but are ignored by Python

To begin comment use #

For multi-line comments or documentation, use triple quotes:

"""
This is a multi-line comment
or documentation string (docstring).
"""
