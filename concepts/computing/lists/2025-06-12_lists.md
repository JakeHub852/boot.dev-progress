# Python Lists

Lists are a natural way to organize and store data. In some languages they're called *arrays*, but in Python, they're simply called **lists**.

Many things in software are organized into lists:

- A social media feed is a list of posts  
- An online store is a list of products  
- A chess game is a list of moves  

## Declaring Lists

Lists are created using square brackets `[]`, with items separated by commas.

```python
inventory = ["Iron Breastplate", "Healing Potion", "Leather Scraps"]
````

Lists can contain any data type. The example above is a list of strings.

## Multi-line Lists

For better readability, especially with long or many items, lists can be split over multiple lines.

```python
flower_types = [
    "daffodil",
    "rose",
    "chrysanthemum"
]

player_ages = [
    23,
    18,
    31,
    42
]
```

This is a stylistic choice. Both single-line and multi-line formats behave the same.

## Indexing and Counting

Python uses **zero-based indexing**. That means the first item in a list is at index `0`.

```python
names = ["Bob", "Lane", "Alice", "Breanna"]
```

* names\[0] is "Bob"
* names\[1] is "Lane"
* names\[2] is "Alice"
* names\[3] is "Breanna"

## Accessing List Items

Use square brackets with the index to access a specific item.

```python
best_languages = ["JavaScript", "Go", "Rust", "Python", "C"]
print(best_languages[1])
# Output: Go
```

## List Length

Use the `len()` function to get the number of items in a list.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "pear"]
length = len(fruits)
# length = 3
```

Note: The highest index is always `len(list) - 1`.

## Appending to a List

Use `.append()` to add items to the end of a list.

```python
cards = []
cards.append("nvidia")
cards.append("amd")
# cards = ['nvidia', 'amd']
```

## Popping from a List

Use `.pop()` to remove and return the last item from a list.

```python
vegetables = ["broccoli", "cabbage", "kale", "tomato"]
last_vegetable = vegetables.pop()
# vegetables = ['broccoli', 'cabbage', 'kale']
# last_vegetable = 'tomato'
```

## Looping Through a List (Index-based)

Use a loop and `range()` to iterate using indexes.

```python
sports = ["soccer", "basketball", "tennis"]
for i in range(0, len(sports)):
    print(sports[i])
```

## Looping Through a List (Value-based)

If you donâ€™t need the index, loop directly over the items.

```python
trees = ["oak", "pine", "maple"]
for tree in trees:
    print(tree)
```

This is cleaner when you just need to access each value.
