## Python Tuples Overview

### What is a Tuple?

A **tuple** is a collection of data that is:

* **Ordered**
* **Immutable** (unchangeable)

You can think of a tuple as a **fixed-size list**. Tuples are defined using **parentheses** `()`.

#### Example:

```python
my_tuple = ("this is a tuple", 45, True)
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: this is a tuple
print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: 45
print(my_tuple[2])  # Output: True
```

Unlike lists, it's acceptable and common to mix types in a tuple since their structure doesn't change.

### Tuples as Small Groupings

Tuples are typically used for **small, fixed-size groupings** of related data.

#### Example:

```python
dog = ("Fido", 4)
```

This is convenient when the structure is known and constantâ€”like a name and age pair.

---

### Single-Item Tuples

To create a **single-item tuple**, you must include a trailing comma. Without the comma, Python will interpret it as just a value inside parentheses.

#### Example:

```python
dog = ("Fido",)  # This is a tuple
not_a_tuple = ("Fido")  # This is just a string
```

---

### Lists of Tuples

Tuples can be stored inside lists. Each tuple remains immutable, but the list can still be modified.

#### Example:

```python
my_tuples = [
    ("this is the first tuple in the list", 45, True),
    ("this is the second tuple in the list", 21, False)
]

print(my_tuples[0][0])  # Output: this is the first tuple in the list
print(my_tuples[0][1])  # Output: 45
print(my_tuples[1][0])  # Output: this is the second tuple in the list
print(my_tuples[1][2])  # Output: False
```

---

### Tuple Unpacking

Tuple **unpacking** allows you to assign multiple variables at once using the structure of a tuple.

#### Example:

```python
dog = ("Fido", 4)
dog_name, dog_age = dog

print(dog_name)  # Output: Fido
print(dog_age)   # Output: 4
```

This is commonly used when **returning multiple values** from a function, as Python returns them in a tuple.

### Summary

* Tuples are like lists but immutable.
* Defined using `()`.
* Useful for grouping related data.
* Can be nested inside lists.
* Support unpacking for quick variable assignments.
