# Binary Numbers

Binary numbers are "base-2" numbers. They work just like our usual "base-10" (decimal) numbers, but they use **only two symbols**: `0` and `1`.

### Base Comparison

- **Base-2 (Binary)**: `0`, `1`
- **Base-10 (Decimal)**: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`

### Binary Place Values

Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2, just like each position in a decimal number represents a power of 10.
````
For example, in a **4-digit binary number**, the place values are:

```

Binary:     1   0   1   0
Place:      8   4   2   1
Value:    1×8 + 0×4 + 1×2 + 0×1 = 10

```

In decimal, a 4-digit number like `2034` has place values based on powers of 10:

```

Decimal:  2   0   3   4
Place:  1000 100  10   1

````

### Binary in Python

Python supports binary literals using the `0b` prefix:

```python
print(0b0001)  # Outputs: 1
print(0b0101)  # Outputs: 5
print(0b1010)  # Outputs: 10
````

This can be useful when working with low-level data, such as bit manipulation or binary file formats.

Binary is foundational to how computers work because it directly maps to **on/off** electrical signals. Every number, character, and instruction inside a computer is ultimately represented in binary.
