# Exponents

Python has built-in support for **exponents** â€” something that many other languages require a math library for.

You can use the `**` operator to raise a number to a power.
````
## Example

```python
# Reads as "three squared" or "three raised to the second power"
3 ** 2
# 9
````

This means 3 multiplied by itself 2 times, or:

```python
3 * 3
# 9
```

You can raise any number to any power:

```python
2 ** 3
# 8

5 ** 1
# 5

10 ** 0
# 1
```

The result will be an integer if both numbers are whole, or a float if decimals are involved.
