# Python Numbers

In Python, numbers without a decimal point are called **integers** â€” just like they are in mathematics.

Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example:

- `3` and `-3` are both integers.

Arithmetic can be performed as you might expect:

````
## Addition
```python
2 + 1
# 3
````

## Subtraction

```python
2 - 1
# 1
```

## Multiplication

```python
2 * 2
# 4
```

## Division

```python
3 / 2
# 1.5
```

> **Note**: Division between two integers produces a `float` (a number with a decimal point).

A **float** is the number type that allows for decimal values, like `1.5` or `-2.75`.
