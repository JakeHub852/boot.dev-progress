## Plus Equals
Python makes reassignment easy when doing math. In JavaScript or Go, you might be familiar with the ++ syntax for incrementing a number variable by 1. In Python, we use the += in-place operator instead.

````python
star_rating = 4
star_rating += 1
# star_rating is now 5

>Other Operators

The other in-place operators work similarly:
````python
star_rating = 4
star_rating -= 1
# star_rating is now 3

star_rating = 4
star_rating *= 2
# star_rating is now 8

star_rating = 4
star_rating /= 2
# star_rating is now 2.0
