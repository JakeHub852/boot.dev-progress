## Functions â€“ Reusing Code

Functions allow us to **organize** and **reuse** code, which is especially useful when performing the same task multiple times (like calculating the area of circles with different radii).
````
### Problem Without Functions

```python
radius = 5
area1 = 3.14 * radius * radius

radius2 = 7
area2 = 3.14 * radius2 * radius2
```

This works, but it's **inefficient** and **repetitive**, especially if we need to calculate the area of many circles.

### Solution: Define a Function

```python
def area_of_circle(r):
    pi = 3.14
    result = pi * r * r
    return result
```

#### Function Breakdown:

* `area_of_circle` is the function name.
* `r` is the **parameter** (input).
* The **body** is indented and runs every time we call the function.
* The function **returns** the calculated result.

---

### Using the Function

```python
area = area_of_circle(5)
print(area)  # 78.5
```

* `5` is passed in as `r`
* Function calculates `3.14 * 5 * 5`
* Returns `78.5`, which is stored in `area`

### Reusability

```python
print(area_of_circle(6))  # 113.04
print(area_of_circle(7))  # 153.86
```

We can now calculate the area for any circle just by calling `area_of_circle()` with a different radius.
