# Scope

Scope refers to where a variable or function name is available to be used. For example, when we create variables in a function (such as by giving names to our parameters), that data is not available outside of that function.

## Local Scope

When a variable is defined inside a function, it only exists within that function. Attempting to access it outside of that function will result in an error.

**Example:**
```python
def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

result = subtract(5, 3)
print(x)  # ERROR! "name 'x' is not defined"
````

In this example, the variable `x` is local to the `subtract` function and cannot be accessed outside of it.

## Global Scope

So far, we've been working in the global scope. That means that when we define a variable or a function at the top level of our program, that name is accessible everywhere else in the program, including within functions.

**Example:**

```python
pi = 3.14

def get_area_of_circle(radius):
    return pi * radius * radius
```

Because `pi` was declared in the global scope, it is usable within the `get_area_of_circle()` function.

```
