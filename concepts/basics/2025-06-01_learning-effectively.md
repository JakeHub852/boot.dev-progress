### Process for Solving Hard Coding Problems

1. **Read the lesson first**
   Understand the concepts and study the examples before attempting the problem.

2. **Understand the assignment**
   Carefully read the assignment to make sure you know what the goal is before writing any code.

3. **Start writing code**
   Begin implementing your solution based on your understanding of the problem.

4. **Use `print()` statements early and often**

   * Donâ€™t wait until you've written a lot of code to start testing.
   * Add `print()` statements as you go.
   * Use the Run button frequently to verify that your code behaves as expected.
   * Debug in small, manageable chunks.

5. **Iterate: Run, print, and fix**
   Keep testing and fixing your code until you're confident it works correctly.

6. **Submit your code**

   * If the assignment has unit tests, it's okay to leave debugging `print()` statements in.
   * If the assignment checks console output, be sure to remove all debugging output before submission.

7. **Review the instructor's solution**
   After successfully completing the assignment, compare your solution to the instructor's to learn different approaches or optimizations.
