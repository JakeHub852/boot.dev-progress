## üßò The Zen of Python  
*By Tim Peters*

> Beautiful is better than ugly.  
> Explicit is better than implicit.  
> Simple is better than complex.  
> Complex is better than complicated.  
> Flat is better than nested.  
> Sparse is better than dense.  
> Readability counts.  
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.  
> Although practicality beats purity.  
> Errors should never pass silently.  
> Unless explicitly silenced.  
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.  
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.  
> Now is better than never.  
> Although never is often better than right now.  
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.  
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## ‚úÖ Why Python?

- **Easy to read and write**: Python reads like English. Great for implementing advanced ideas like AI.
- **Popular**: 3rd most used language in 2024 (Stack Overflow survey).
- **Free and open source**: Easy to install, use, and share.
- **Portable**: Code runs across platforms with minimal changes.
- **Interpreted**: Fast iteration and deployment without compilation steps.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why *Not* Python?

- **Slow performance**: Not ideal for performance-critical applications like high-end games.
- **Large codebases can be risky**: Python‚Äôs dynamic typing can make large projects harder to maintain.
- **Not user-friendly for non-devs**: End users often need to install Python separately to run apps.

## üîÄ Python 2 vs Python 3

Python 3 is the modern standard ‚Äî and what this course used. Python 2 still exists in the wild, but is officially deprecated.

### Print syntax comparison:
```python
# Python 2
print "hello world"

# Python 3
print("hello world")
