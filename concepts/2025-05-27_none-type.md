# 🧠 `NoneType` in Python: Quick Reference

## 🔍 What is `None`?

* `None` is a special **keyword** in Python that represents the **absence of a value**.
* It is **not** the same as:

  * An empty string `""`
  * The number `0`
  * The string `"None"`

```python
username = None  # This means username has no value yet
```

---

## ✅ Why Use `None`?

### ✔ As a **default placeholder**:

Use `None` when you know a variable will be assigned later.

```python
age = None  # Will be filled later
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```

### ✔ To check if a value has been set:

```python
if age is None:
    print("Age not set yet!")
else:
    print(f"You are {age} years old.")
```

## 🚫 What NOT to do

* Don’t confuse `None` with `"None"`:

  * `"None"` is a **string**, not the special `None` value.
* Don’t use `""` or `0` as placeholders:

  * `""` means an empty string (valid input).
  * `0` is a number (could be valid data, like a baby's age).

---

## 📌 Use Cases

* Waiting for **user input**:

```python
occupation = None
occupation = input("What’s your occupation? ")
```

* Placeholder for **future data** (e.g., from API or file).
* Checking **form completion**:

```python
if marital_status is None:
    print("Please fill out your marital status.")
```

---

## 🧪 Type Checking

```python
print(type(None))  # <class 'NoneType'>
```

---

## 🧠 Summary

* `None` is Python’s way of saying “nothing here… yet.”
* Use it to keep code clean, clear, and logical when waiting for real values.
