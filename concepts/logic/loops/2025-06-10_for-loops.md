# Looping with `range(start, end, step)`

In Python, the `range()` function is commonly used in `for` loops to generate a sequence of numbers. You can control how the loop counts using three arguments:
````
```python
range(start, end, step)
````

* `start`: The number to start from (inclusive)
* `end`: The number to stop at (exclusive)
* `step`: How much to increment by each time

---

## Examples

### Count by 1 (default)

```python
for i in range(0, 5):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

### Count by 2

```python
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

Output:

```
0
2
4
6
8
```

### Example: Sum of Odd Numbers

You can use a `step` of `2` to loop through only odd numbers:

```python
def sum_of_odd_numbers(end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, end, 2):  # Start at 1, skip by 2
        total += i
    return total
```

### Example:

```python
sum_of_odd_numbers(10)
# Adds: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25
```

---

### Example: Sum of Even Numbers

To loop through even numbers, start at 0 instead:

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(0, end, 2):
        total += i
    return total
```

```python
sum_of_even_numbers(10)
# Adds: 0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20
```

---

## Summary

* Use `range(start, end, step)` to control how a loop counts.
* Use a `step` of `2` to skip every other number â€” useful for even or odd numbers.
* You can build useful patterns like summing specific types of numbers using this.

This pattern is common in beginner Python programming, especially when working with numbers.
