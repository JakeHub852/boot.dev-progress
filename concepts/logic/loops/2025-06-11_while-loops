## `while` Loops in Python

Python provides another type of loop called the `while` loop. This loop continues to execute **as long as a given condition remains `True`**.

### Basic Syntax

```python
while condition:
    # code block
```

### Infinite Loop Example

```python
while 1:
    print("1 evaluates to True")
```

**Output:**

```
1 evaluates to True
1 evaluates to True
...
```

This loop runs forever because `1` always evaluates to `True`. This is called an **infinite loop**.

### Typical Use Case with a Condition

Usually, the condition in a `while` loop involves a variable or comparison that eventually becomes `False`, stopping the loop.

```python
num = 0
while num < 3:
    num += 1
    print(num)
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
```

Here, the loop runs until `num` is no longer less than `3`.
