# Why Python Isn’t Used for Frontend Development

## Summary
Python is rarely used for frontend development, especially in web browsers, because browsers do not natively support Python—they are built to run JavaScript.

## Key Points
- Browsers understand JavaScript, not Python.
- Tools like Brython or Pyodide allow Python in browsers but introduce overhead.
- Using Python in the browser results in slower apps and limited access to browser APIs.

## Analogy
> Using Python in the browser is like planting a palm tree in the snowy north—it’s out of its element.

## Python Is Great For:
- Backend development (Flask, Django)
- Automation and scripting
- Machine learning and data analysis
